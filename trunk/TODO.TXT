
PUZZLES
* Support from 2 to N-dimensional puzzles (yeah right!).
* Fix the puzzles containing triangles.
* Port the solve and compress functions to the new puzzles. 
  First just for the appropriately sized cubes and eventually for all puzzles.


HIGHLIGHTING
* Disallow 360 degree twists.
* In highlight-stickers mode, only highlight hovered-over stickers that would 
  do something if clicked. For center-center stickers that would require the Ctrl key being held.

GUI
* Replace the AWT class usages with Swing versions.
* Move control panel to the west.
* Add Synthetica look-and-feel.

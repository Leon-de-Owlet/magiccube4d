
PUZZLES
* Support from 2 to N-dimensional puzzles (yeah right!).
* Port the solve and compress functions to the new puzzles. 
  First just for the appropriately sized cubes and eventually for all puzzles.
* DONE - Figure out how to support rotations for generic puzzles & history.
* DONE - Implement Jenn3D-style 4D rotates via Shift-left drag.
* before shipping, comment out broken or redundant puzzles and change default to "{4,3,3} 3"
* Make twist speed adjustable mid-twist.
* Need isSolved method to determine when a true solve has been achieved.
* Add an MC120-like piece finding functionality.

HIGHLIGHTING
* Disallow 360 degree twists.
* In highlight-stickers mode, only highlight hovered-over stickers that would 
  do something if clicked. For center-center stickers that would require the Ctrl key being held.

GUI
* Choose better slider ranges.
* Fix or remove contigious cubies mode.
* Reenable "Reset to Defaults" button in the preferences panel and sync prefs with Viwe4D without losing puzzle state.
* Make initial EyeW a function of puzzle size and maybe remove slider altogether?
* Add cross-eyed stereo viewing mode.
* DONE - Add a debugging FPS meter.
* DONE - Replace the AWT class usages with Swing versions.
* DONE - Move control panel to the west.
* DONE - Add Synthetica look-and-feel.
* DONE - Add a puzzle-building progress bar to the status line for feedback during slicing, etc.
* DONE - Add ctrl-click-to-center modes.

LOG FILES
* Maybe keep printing puzzle state data but skip over reading it and initialize from history data instead.
* DONE - Force file names to end with ".log".
* DONE - Save transform matrix in the file.

BUGS
* Canceled cheats don't finish properly when restarted.
* DONE - Fix Cheat after scramble.
* Fix scramble for edge lengths > 4. (Different faces can have effectively different numbers of slices).
* Fix Quick Moves.
* Full scramble on simplex yields inconsistent numbers of history twists. (Watch twist counter in lower right.)
* DONE - Fix color buttons and remove the 6 fixed color choices.
* DONE - Fix macro cancel.
* DONE - Fix slices masks.
* Fix the puzzles containing triangles.
* Fix macro apply.
* DONE - Fix disconnected histories in reset, scramble, and other operations.
* Fix "whichax out of range" errors
* Fix random Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 4042
	at GenericPipelineUtils.paintFrame(GenericPipelineUtils.java:683)
* Fix horrible behavior when attempting to twist center-center stickers, or better yet
  Don't highlight or allow twist attempts on them in the first place.
* Make Esc key cancel solve/cheat animations even when 3D window does not have focus.
* Fix so that building new puzzle releases memory used by previous puzzle. (by removing listeners?)

META
* Get Eclipse to output executable jar files or modify my batch file and check it in.
* Generally clean up the abstractions. Especially try to eliminate old PuzzleState and PolygonManager 
  classes and eliminate or prune and rename GenericGlue class. 
* Get rid of Stickerspec.id_within_face if possible. I think it's not really needed.
* Turn this list into tracked bugs & tasks

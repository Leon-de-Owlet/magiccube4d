
PUZZLES
* Support from 2 to N-dimensional puzzles (yeah right!).
* Port the solve and compress functions to the new puzzles. 
  First just for the appropriately sized cubes and eventually for all puzzles.
* DONE - Figure out how to support rotations for generic puzzles & history.
* Implement Jenn3D-style 4D rotates via Shift-left drag.
* Implement right-drag spin (X) and scale (Y)
* Comment out broken or redundant puzzles before shipping.
* Make twist speed adjustable mid-twist.

HIGHLIGHTING
* Disallow 360 degree twists.
* In highlight-stickers mode, only highlight hovered-over stickers that would 
  do something if clicked. For center-center stickers that would require the Ctrl key being held.

GUI
* Choose better slider ranges.
* Fix or remove contigious cubies mode.
* DONE - Replace the AWT class usages with Swing versions.
* DONE - Move control panel to the west.
* DONE - Add Synthetica look-and-feel.
* DONE - Add a puzzle-building progress bar to the status line for feedback during slicing, etc.
* DONE - Add ctrl-click-to-center modes.

LOG FILES
* Maybe keep printing puzzle state data but skip over reading it and initialize from history data instead.
* Force file names to end with ".log".
* Save transform matrix in the file.

BUGS
* Fix Quick Moves.
* Fix color buttons and remove the 6 fixed color choices.
* DONE - Fix macro cancel.
* DONE - Fix slices masks.
* Fix the puzzles containing triangles.
* Fix macro apply.
* DONE - Fix disconnected histories in reset, scramble, and other operations.
* Fix "whichax out of range" errors
* Fix horrible behavior when attempting to twist center-center stickers, or better yet
  Don't highlight or allow twist attempts on them in the first place.
* Make Esc key cancel solve/cheat animations even when 3D window does not have focus.
* Fix so that building new puzzle releases memory used by previous puzzle. (by removing listeners?)
